        <ul> Ingredients
            <ul> Beef Tenderloin Roast
                <li>1 center-cut beef tenderloin roast (4 to 4 ½ pounds), trimmed and tied</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons avocado oil</li>
            </ul>
            <ul> Garlic Herb Butter
                <li>6 tablespoons softened butter</li>
                <li>6 garlic cloves, minced</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme leaves</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <ol>Instructions:
            <li>Remove the beef tenderloin from the fridge and let it come to room temperature prior to cooking, about 1 to 2 hours.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together the butter, garlic, rosemary, and thyme. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Slice the beef tenderloin in half, then trim and tie it up (if it hasn't already been done by the butcher). </li>
            <li>Use paper towels to pat any excess moisture from the beef tenderloin, then season both sides with salt and pepper. </li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the beef tenderloin and brown for a few minutes on all sides, about 10 minutes total, to create a golden brown crust.</li>
            <li>Slather the butter herb mixture over the top side of the beef tenderloin, then transfer the entire pan to the oven. If using a probe thermometer, insert the probe before placing the tenderloin in the oven. Roast the beef tenderloin for 15-20 minutes, depending on how you like your meat cooked (see temperature tips above). </li>
            <li>Remove the beef tenderloin from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Let it rest for 10 to 15 minutes, to allow the juices to redistribute. Then remove the twine and slice into 1-inch thick pieces. If you'd like, serve with horseradish sauce.</li>
        </ol>
